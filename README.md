# Supply Chain Optimization with Linear Programming

## Overview  
This project explores **supply chain planning and optimization** using **linear programming (LP)**. It formulates and solves three key supply chain problems to **minimize costs and maximize efficiency**. The implementation is flexible and scalable, making it applicable to real-world logistics challenges.

## Problem Scenarios  
1. **Warehouse Planning** – Determines the **optimal fulfillment center (FC) selection** to minimize costs while meeting demand.  
2. **Supply Chain Planning** – Creates an **abstract formulation for production and distribution planning**, balancing capacity constraints and transportation costs.  
3. **Multi-Product Supply Chain Optimization** – Extends the model to **multi-product scenarios**, with a reusable optimization function to process large datasets.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Gurobi)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Linear Programming (LP)**  
- **Excel (for input/output data handling)**  

## How to Use  
- Run the **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** to explore the models interactively.  
- The **Python function `optimizeShipment`** enables solving different supply chain instances by reading input files and generating optimal shipping plans.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Optimized supply chain decisions** reduce costs and improve logistics efficiency.  
- **Reusable optimization models** enable adaptability for different business cases.  
- **Data-driven decision-making** is crucial for complex supply chain operations.  

## Files Included  
- **`supply_chain_optimization.ipynb`** – Main Jupyter Notebook with problem formulation and solutions.  
- **`data files`** – Example input & output files from the optimization models.  
- **`README.md`** – Project overview and usage instructions.
