    "Nia is a data analyst at Trojan E-commerce, a medium sized online retailer with 17 fulfilment centers scattered across the US. She would like to apply optimization to minimize the weekly outbound shipping cost from fulfilment centers to customers. Trojan uses UPS 2-day delivery. Based on a regression analysis, she found that the cost of shipping each unit of item $k$ from fulfillment center (FC) $i$ to demand region $j$ is $1.38 w_k \\delta_{ij}$, where $w_k$ is the shipping weight of the item and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the distance from FC $i$ to region $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Trojan E-commerce sells hundreds of thousands of items, Nia conducted a clustering analysis to simplify the analysis and found 100 representative items, and she scaled up the demand for these so that they can serve as a proxy for all the items. Nia has also partitioned the US into 98 demand regions, and has estimated the weekly demand from each demand region for each of the representative items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trojan is committed to satisfying all customer demand for all of the items at all demand regions. The weekly demand for item $k$ in region $j$ is given as $d_{jk}$. However, Trojan can choose how much of this to provide from each FC. Using a closer FC would reduce the shipping cost, but capacity at each FC is limited. (For simplicity, assume that fractional amounts of items is allowed, so the amount shipped does not have to be an integer.) The company replenishes inventory every week. At any given FC, the amount of capacity required for processing each unit of item $k$ is equal to $s_k$. The total capacity of FC $i$ is given as $q_i$.\n",
